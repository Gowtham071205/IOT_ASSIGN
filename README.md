# ESP32 MQTT Sensor Simulation (Wokwi + Mosquitto)

###  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use an **ESP32** board running **MicroPython** to publish sensor readings (LDR and Temperature) and receive control commands (LED ON/OFF) via the **MQTT protocol**.  
The simulation runs entirely in **Wokwi** and communicates with the public MQTT broker **test.mosquitto.org**.

##  Features
 Publishes sensor readings (Light & Temperature)  
 Receives LED control commands via MQTT  
 Uses public broker for easy testing  
 Works entirely in Wokwi simulation  
 Demonstrates bidirectional MQTT communication
